      <p>Hi! My name is <a href="https://outschool.com/teachers/HelenBird#abl2ddzqdj" target="_blank">Helen</a> and I am a qualified primary school teacher based in the UK.  I have 2 small children so am taking a break from a full time teaching job after a 15 year career in British schools.<br><br><br>

        After graduating from Oxford University with a BA degree, I then went on to achieve an MA degree  in Primary Education.  I have a particular interest in Early Years, Maths, English, History, Geography, Science and the 11 Plus Exam.<br><br><br>

        I believe that learning can be great fun and is the key to opening many doors for children.  I am particularly passionate about good phonics teaching for young children and creating a love of learning that will carry them through life.  Over the last 2 years I have spent many hours tutoring children who have fallen behind due to Covid19, mainly in maths and English.<br><br><br>

        I have thoroughly enjoyed seeing these children make such amazing progress and would like to continue to do this through Outschool.  I also enjoy helping children to achieve their full potential in passing the UK 11+ Exam and have seen many of my pupils go on to enjoy a place in Grammar School.<br><br><br>

        I live at home with my husband, our 2 young children and Teddy the dog (who sometimes makes an appearance in lessons!).  Our favourite books to read are Horrid Henry and The Trouble With Daisy as all children can relate to those characters in some way! </p>
