    <div class="question">
      <p>Where do the lessons take place?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
      <p>The lessons are remote and take place on the Outschool website. Helen teaches the class online on a video web conference where the children can actively participate and learn. There are a multitude of activities and optional homeworks Helen sets for class attendees to do through the file sharing feature. All classes aim to be fun first but very helpful and educational for your child.</p>
